I do Silver Sea Remnants and with and without Ammo on the first Lamp it takes 10-15/20-25 minutes respectively to rush through to the bosses and kill them both.

I took the liberty of creating a masterful treasure map to guide you on your quest:



Here's a step by step. Remember to use Fleet Wind as much as possible!

1) Skip floor one, you can unlock all of that later.

2) Depending on whether you get HP or MP on the first lamp you'll need to kill a particular Fomor to get what you're missing. If you got MP, you need to kill a Thief, and if you got HP, you need to kill a Paladin or Black Mage. Following the route I drew the first Rampart will spawn Thief x3, the second Paladin x3, or if you manage to link the Ramparts, one of those sets will be Black Mage x3. Either way, Thiefs drop HP, Paladins and Black Mages MP.

What I do here, as you're still likely quite weak (unless you got Ammo on the first lamp) is Summoner pull whichever Rampart I need: First for HP, second for MP. If going for the second try linking the first as it'll spawn Black Mages and they're much squishier. Stick Ifrit on the monster you need, blood pact him because why not, then run to a safe distance and dismiss and resummon. Stick Ifrit on the Fomor, the Rampart will take ages to get to you anyway. Fight them in the middle or in the corridor, prioritise getting the Fomor down as the rampart is weak, even on your ungeared character. When that's done down the rampart. You can run further up the corridor the way you came to fight if you like and this will potentially deaggro the rampart. Meleeing with an i119 Staff will drastically speed this up but take care to watch your HP If you got MP on the first floor!

Summon Garuda, Fleet Wind, Sneak up, and run up to the next floor. Skipping monsters on this floor will aggro a bunch of Ramparts and whatever monsters they spawn. That's fine, you run much faster with Fleet Wind and can easily open the doors and go up the teleporter before any catch up to you. I've never come close to dying yet!

3) Skip all the way to where I drew the gears on the map. In the corners of this room there will be Ramparts. Aggroing one will spawn three Gears and one Gear. The Gear drops Ammo so pull him first. I stick Ifrit on the gear I want, run back to the room behind me and dismiss him, resummmoning in time for the Gear to get there. The Rampart deaggroes almost every time (in 20 something runs he only came once.)

If you got ammo at the start pull him anyway, as he'll also unlock gear slots.

Kill the gear (this might be a struggle, but meleeing helps, again keep your HP up!) and then you get Ammo and a load of gear slots too. Yay! Now it's going to be much easier. Go back to the room, pull the first gear, kill it to get the item slots you're missing and then go up the portal. You can summoner pull one on its own again if you're not comfortable having three bashing on Ifrit with only 600 HP.

Cast Fleet Wind before you go up, as time is of the essence on this floor.

4) Run all the way to where I've drawn Dvergr with Sneak up. There's a lot of Ramparts on the way, avoid them all. There will be one in the large horizontal room going backwards and forwards in front of you, but he's never aggroed me, ever, whereas deviating to the sides to try and avoid him has always aggroed the ones on the sides. If you do aggro, keep running all the way to the Dvergr room to unlock the door, as allegedly his being there is determined by how quickly you reach the door. Running through with a pet is a good idea as the pet will auto attack the Rampart if it aggroes, getting hate on it and all the monsters that spawn as a result. You can then dismiss him and just kill the Rampart, or let it deaggro. Just be mindful that any other monsters otw will link with the Rampart.

Dvergr is very easy. Use Ifrit. Don't melee, he has nasty AoEs. Some fights Ifrit dies, others he doesn't - seems to be random. Be mindful of this by watching his HP, I prefer to run up the corridor north (leading to boss floor) and resummon rather than use mulsums especially as Dvergr will stop to cast spells and give me so much damn time to resummon! When Dvergr is dead (4/21 on Linens here) head up to the boss floor.

5) Just run to the boss and repeat the process on Dvergr. He seems to be even easier, weirdly. I blow Astral Conduit on this guy if it's ready because it's fun watching Ifrit shred the guy who gave my Salvage 2 group a torrid time back in the day. ;)

Sorry, I was a bit more elaborate than I planned there. It might seem long winded but once you do this for yourself you'll see it's very straight forward. Without Ammo runs take me 20-25 minutes with very bad gear. With much better gear I don't see why it shouldn't take you 20 minutes at the most, possibly half that if you unlock Ammo. Fleet Wind really speeds this up, especially as we can skip most of it!

So 10-25 minutes for 99-198 Alexandrite (plus the occasional ones from Gears) - I'll take it!
